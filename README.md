# Python üêç Basics Workshop - What After College

Solutions to all sample problems on HackerRank under the Python domain can be 
looked up [here](https://github.com/anishLearnsToCode/hackerrank-python).

Programming is a very hands process and is both an art as well as a science. We are
engineers and are required to create efficient solutions but at the same time our programs should be 
highly readable and flexible and all the other snappy terms which makes it an art as well.

To become proficient in this art, there are many resources, and books and tutorials. Each has it's merit
and making the first step in any direction is commendable, but the cardinal factor at the end of the day
will be you sitting down (or standing) and writing code. No book or resource can substitute that.

So, what are you waiting for üòÄüòâ - try as many questions (below or otherwise) as you can.... üê±‚Äçüë§    
Happy Coding :octocat: üê±‚Äçüíª
